    "This notebook drills down into a pretty old mechanism to represent text as numbers called TF-IDF a.k.a Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is TF-IDF? \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, to understand what text is about, we look for words that occur frequently. Term frequency covers that aspect by capturing the number of times each word occurs in the text. To downgrade the relative importance of words that occur all too frequently, an inverse weighting is introduced to scale down the words that occur too frequently. This inverse weighting is referred to as Inverse Document Frequency. Together, TF-IDF captures the relative importance of words in a set of documents or a collection of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many great articles written on the intuition behind TF-IDF and not many written on how to derive the exact values for TF-IDF. The focus of this notebook is to piece together various calculations involved and provide how to derive each step programmatically so that you can derive it on the texts you are working with. We will look at the maths involved in an intuitive way as we go along. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a beautiful poem by mystic poet Rumi as our example corpus. First, we will calculate TF IDF values for the poem using TF IDF Vectoriser from the sklearn package. Then, we will pull apart the various components and work through various steps involved in calculating TF-IDF values. Mathematical calculations and Python code will be provided for each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding TF-IDF calculations from scratch will help you with developing better intuitions on the results you obtain from applying any algorithm on TF-IDF values."

    "\n",
    "To illustrate the various steps involved, we need to keep the corpus as small as possible. I chanced upon this quote / beautiful poem from the 13th century Persian Poet and Sufi Mystic Rumi (Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī) and it fits our use case perfectly. So, we will be using this poem as our list of documents with each sentence considered as a document."

    "In the field of Natural Language Processing, word embedding in 2013 and language models in 2018 have changed the landscape and led to many state of the art models for problems in NLP. So, it seems a bit strange that here in 2020, I have chosen to talk about TF IDF which was first formulated in 1970. Here are my 2 reasons why I think it is good to understand the underlying calculations.\n",
    "1. Understanding TF-IDF makes it one step easier to understand the results of algorithms you apply on top of TF-IDF. \n",
    "2. In 2018, Google released a text classification framework based on 450K experiments on a few different text sets. In text classification problems, the algorithms have to predict the topic based on a predefined set of topics it has trained on. Text classification problem is a common problem to solve for many companies. Based on the 450K experiments, Google found that when the number of samples/number of words < 1500, TF IDF was the best way to represent text. "
